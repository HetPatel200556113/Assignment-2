            <p>A club isn't the best place to find a lover</p>
            <p>So the bar is where I go (Mm)</p>
            <p> Me and my friends at the table doin' shots</p>
            <p> Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)</p>
            <p>And you come over and start up a conversation with just me</p>
            <p> And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)</p>
            <p>Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox</p>
            <p>And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like</p>


            <p>Girl, you know I want your love</p>
            <p>Your love was handmade for somebody like me</p>
            <p> Well, come on now, follow my lead</p>
            <p>I may be crazy, don't mind me</p>
            <p> Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"</p>
            <p> Grab on my waist and put that body on me</p>
            <p> Well, come on now, follow my lead</p>
            <p> Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm</p>

            <p>I'm in love with the shape of you</p>
            <p>We push and pull like a magnet do</p>
            <p>Although my heart is fallin' too</p>
            <p>I'm in love with your body</p>
            <p>And last night, you were in my room</p>
            <p>And now my bed sheets smell like you</p>
            <p>Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new</p>
            <p>Well, I'm in love with your body</p>

            <p>Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I</p>
            <p>Well, I'm in love with your body</p>
            <p>Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I</p>
            <p>Well, I'm in love with your body</p>
            <p>Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I</p>
            <p>Well, I'm in love with your body</p>
            <p>Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new</p>
            <p>I'm in love with the shape of you</p>

            <p>One week in, we let the story begin</p>
            <p>We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)</p>
            <p>You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat</p>
            <p>Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)</p>
            <p>We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour</p>
            <p>And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)</p>
            <p>And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat</p>
            <p>Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like</p>

            <p>Girl, you know I want your love</p>
            <p>Your love was handmade for somebody like me</p>

            <p>Grab on my waist and put that body on me</p>
            <p>Well, come on now, follow my lead</p>
            <p>Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm</p>
